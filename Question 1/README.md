# Question 1 — .NET / OOP

You are building a tiny ordering tool for a table‑tennis shop.

**Task**
- Complete the code in `Question_1.cs`.
- Add three concrete item classes: `Table`, `Paddle`, and `Balls`.
- Use inheritance and abstraction properly (`Item` is abstract).
- Each item must have a price and weight.
- Implement `getFullPrice()` to return the price including a 20% tax.
- Add one table, two paddles, and three packs of balls to `items`.
- Print the item name and full price for each entry.

**Deliverables**
- Updated `Question_1.cs` with working, readable code.
- A short note explaining your class design choices.
