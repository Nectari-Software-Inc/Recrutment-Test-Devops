# Question 4 — Investigation / Production Slowness

Your production application is slow. It runs on a VM in Azure, and the database is Azure SQL. Customers are complaining about response times.

**Task**
- Explain, step by step, how you would investigate from the first alert to the final fix.
- Focus on your investigation mindset: what you check first, what signals you look for, and how you narrow down root cause.
- Assume you have access to Azure Monitor, VM metrics, and SQL performance insights.

**Deliverables**
- A written plan (bullet points are fine).
- Include the commands/tools you would use where relevant.
- Explain how you would validate the fix and prevent regression.
