# DevOps Test Sources

This repository contains five short, practical questions for a DevOps engineer interview. Each question lives in its own folder with a README that explains the task and the expected deliverables.

## How to use
- Give the candidate the whole repository or the specific question folder.
- Ask for a short written answer plus any code/files they create.
- If a question asks for code changes, the candidate should modify the files in that folder only.

## Questions
1. **.NET / OOP** – Classes, inheritance, abstraction.
2. **PowerShell** – Fetch JSON, build objects, format output.
3. **Docker / MSSQL** – Build a clean image with a health check and restored data.
4. **IaC (Terraform)** – Model a simple, reusable cloud resource.
5. **CI/CD** – Build and push the SQL Server image to GitHub Container Registry.
